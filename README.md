# Firewall-Rule-Stimulator
A web-based application designed to simulate how firewall rules behave in response to different types of network traffic. This simulator enables users—especially network admins, security students, and DevOps professionals—to define, test, and visualize custom firewall rules (like those in iptables, cloud security groups, or Windows Firewall) and see how these rules affect incoming and outgoing traffic.

•Allows creation of rules using familiar syntax (e.g., ALLOW TCP FROM 192.168.1.1 TO ANY PORT 22)

•Simulates traffic (e.g., packet source, destination, port, protocol)

•Evaluates which rules are triggered and whether traffic is allowed or denied

•Visualizes the rule matching process step by step

•Supports common rule styles: AWS Security Groups, iptables, UFW, etc.
